<p> When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us..</p>
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.You can either experience the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The choice is yours.
Don’t be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.You’ve got to get up every morning with determination if you’re going to go to bed with satisfaction.
